Ideas and Prelimninary Data Sources

Topic - Vehicle sales over time, trends in vehicle sales, impact of broader economic forces on vehicle sales

Preliminary Questions
1. How have sales in vehicles evolved over time?
	->Have trends varied by market segment (automobiles vs. light trucks vs. heavy trucks etc.)
2. How do vehicle sales respond to changes in broader economic forces such as inflation, median income etc,
as well as gas prices?
3. Can we predict future vehicle sales based on past vehicle sales as well as the economic variables described above?
4. What implications do the above findings have for the stock prices of major automobile OEMs?
